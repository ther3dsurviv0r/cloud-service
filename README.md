# cloud-service

# Welcome to theredsurvivor's cloud server.

Using PHP, HTML and CSS only.

This project is a local cloud service. In a same network you can use the ip address of the main system to access this project. Upload files there and those files will appear on the main system [server].

This project requires Apache server and PHP installed on the main[server] system.
You can get videos on Youtube about setting up apache server and php.
Put all the files in the appropriate folder.

-->Edit php.ini

	-Search for "php.ini" file.
	-Locate max_upload_size and increase the value to upload bigger files.
	-Save the file and restart your appache service.

Password is "password". You can change it in upload.php

Hope this helped you.
Feel free to customise the files to suit your needs. I will be making this project better in the future by adding javascript and other fuctions like progress bar for starters.
